**varnish-towncrier** is designed to distribute cache invalidation requests to a fleet of
[varnish](http://varnish-cache.org/) instances. The agent daemon is listening for PURGE and BAN requests on
a [Redis Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) channel and forwards incoming cache invalidation requests to its local
varnish instance. It's the successor of [varnish-cache-reaper](https://github.com/emgag/varnish-cache-reaper), which is
also used to fan out invalidation requests to multiple varnish instances, though its host list is static while with
varnish-towncrier, each varnish instance registers itself automatically.

It supports PURGE and BAN requests as well as surrogate keys (cache tags) using the
[xkey module](https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules/blob/master/docs/vmod_xkey.rst), formerly known as Hashtwo.

## Requirements

* [Redis](https://redis.io) service, accessible from both the applications issuing invalidation requests as well as the
  varnish instances running the agent.
* [Varnish](http://varnish-cache.org/), obviously. Although as it doesn't use any specific varnish APIs and uses plain
  HTTP, it can probably be configured for other proxies as well.
* VCL has to be modified to support purging, banning and distinguishing the two different xkey purging methods supported
  by varnish-towncrier. See VCL example below.
* Go >=1.17 for building.

## Agent

### Configuration

The agent configuration is done using either a YAML file (
see [varnish-towncrier.yml.dist]([varnish-towncrier.yml.dist])), default location is
*/etc/varnish-towncrier.yml* or through environment variables.

**redis** section:

* uri (*VT_REDIS_URI*): redis host to connect to. Use redis:// for unencrypted, rediss:// for an encrypted connection.
* password (*VT_REDIS_PASSWORD*): provide password if the connection needs to be authenticated.
* subscribe (*VT_REDIS_SUBSCRIBE*): list of pubsub channels the agent will subscribe to. When used within an environment
  variable, a space separated string is used to list multiple values.

**endpoint** section:

* uri (*VT_ENDPOINT_URI*): the HTTP endpoint of the varnish instance.
* xkeyheader (*VT_ENDPOINT_XKEYHEADER*): The header used to supply list of keys to purge using *xkey.purge()*.
* softxkeyheader (*VT_ENDPOINT_SOFTXKEYHEADER*): The header used to supply list of keys to purge using *
  xkey.softpurge()*.
* banheader (*VT_ENDPOINT_BANHEADER*): The header used to supply the expression for *ban()*.
* banurlheader (*VT_ENDPOINT_BANURLHEADER*): The header used to supply the pattern for an URL ban.

Example (default values):

```YAML
redis:
  uri: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
  password: thepasswordifneeeded
  subscribe:
    - varnish.purge
endpoint:
  uri: http://127.0.0.1:8080/
  xkeyheader: x-xkey
  softxkeyheader: x-xkey-soft
  banheader: x-ban-expression
  banurlheader: x-ban-url  
```

### Usage

```
Distribute cache invalidation requests to a fleet of varnish instances.

Usage:
  varnish-towncrier [command]

Available Commands:
  ban         Issue ban request to all registered instances
  help        Help about any command
  listen      Listen for incoming invalidation requests
  purge       Issue purge request to all registered instances
  version     Print the version number of varnish-towncrier
  xkey        Invalidate selected surrogate keys on all registered instances

Flags:
  -c, --config string   config file (default is /etc/varnish-towncrier.yml)
  -h, --help            help for varnish-towncrier

Use "varnish-towncrier [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Example:

```
$ varnish-towncrier -c varnish-towncrier.yml listen
2017/12/14 01:09:14 Connecting to redis...
2017/12/14 01:09:14 Connected to redis://127.0.0.1:6379
2017/12/14 01:09:14 subscribe: varnish.purge (1)
[...]
```

## Docker

varnish-towncrier is packaged for docker with the image

[ghcr.io/emgag/varnish-towncrier](https://github.com/orgs/emgag/packages/container/varnish-towncrier)

and can be configured either by copying a config file to the root or by supplying environment variables.

Example using baked in config file:

``` 
FROM ghcr.io/emgag/varnish-towncrier
COPY varnish-towncrier.yml /varnish-towncrier.yml
```

### Run

```
docker run emgag/varnish-towncrier:latest listen
```

### Kubernetes

varnish-towncrier can be run alongside a varnish container (
like [ghcr.io/emgag/varnish](https://github.com/orgs/emgag/packages/container/varnish))
in a pod to handle cache resets, e.g.

```

## Invalidation request API

Invalidation requests can be sent by publishing to a [Redis Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) channel.

### Message format

The publish message payload consists of a JSON object with following properties:

* **command**: string. Required. Either _ban_, _ban.url_, _purge_, _xkey_ or _xkey.soft_.
* **host**: string. Optional. The _Host_ header used in the PURGE/BAN request to varnish. If omitted, the host is
  derived from the local endpoint's URL.
* **value**: string[]. Required. Meaning depends on the command.
  _ban_: List of [ban() expressions](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/5.2/reference/vcl.html#vcl-7-ban),
  _ban.url_: List of regular expressions matching the path portion of the URL to be banned,
  _purge_: The path portion of the URL to be purged,
  _xkey_ and _xkey.soft_: List of keys to (soft-)purge.

Example:

```JSON
{
  "command": "xkey",
  "host": "www.example.org",
  "value": [
    "still",
    "flying"
  ]
}
```

Using _varnish-towncrier_:

```
$ varnish-towncrier -c config.yml xkey --host www.example.org still flying
```

Using _redis-cli_:

```
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> publish varnish.purge '{"command": "xkey", "host": "www.example.org", "value": ["still", "flying"]}'
```

Using PHP & [Predis](https://github.com/nrk/predis):

```PHP
$client = new Predis\Client([
    'scheme' => 'tcp',
    'host'   => '127.0.0.1',
    'port'   => '6379'
]);

$message = json_encode([
    'command' => 'xkey',
    'host'    => 'www.example.org',
    'value'   => ['still', 'flying']
]);

$client->publish('varnish.purge', $message);
```

Using PHP, [Predis](https://github.com/nrk/predis)
& [varnish-towncrier-php](https://github.com/emgag/varnish-towncrier-php):

```PHP
$client = new Predis\Client([
    'scheme' => 'tcp',
    'host'   => '127.0.0.1',
    'port'   => '6379'
]);

$vt = new VarnishTowncrier($client);
$vt->xkey('example.org', ['still', 'flying']);
```
